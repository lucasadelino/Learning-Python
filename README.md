# Learning Python
This folder contains projects I created while studying Python, including practice projects from [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). I wanted this to document my learning process naturally, warts and all, even if versions of these projects were not particularly efficient, sophisticated, or pythonic.
